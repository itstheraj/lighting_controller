Simple application I made with pyKivy to install on an android tablet.

This way guests in my home could toggle my lights from colorful to white / without me
needing to add them to a google home account.

To run for demo purposes:

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 main.py
```

You would need some apparatus to use TinyTuya / JSONs in the main folder with API keys etc. This is just a quick example.
